#two types of errors--->compile time  and runtime.
#errors which occurs during compilation due to syntax errors mainly
#can be considered as compiletime errors

#errors which occurs during runtime/executiontime due to inputs
#from the user can be considered as runtime errors.


#compiletime errors we need to resolve by writing code without
#any syntax mistakes.

#runtime errors we have to handle by using some techniques like
#exception handling.

#try and except blocks.


# if True:
#     print("hello world")


try:
    x=4
    y=5
    sum=x+y
    print(sum)
except:
    print('error occured')
