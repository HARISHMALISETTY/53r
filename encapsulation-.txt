encapsulation--->grouping and security.
for grouping we will uses classes.
for security we have access modifiers:
1.public
2.protected
3.private.

only single class(no inheritance):
----------------------------------
1.public-->we can access those variable  in same class, through object without any restrictions.
2.protected(_var)-->we are not suppose to access variables outside of class, but we can access which is not recommended.
it is just to give discipline to developers while writing the code.
3.private(__var)--->we can't and not allowed to access variables outside of the class.
but we can hack using name mangling approach (eg:_classname__var) which is not recommended.

but we can use getter and setter methods to access and to update the variables.(which is recommended).

multiple classes with inheritance:
-----------------------------------
1.protected(_var)--->we can allowed to access the variable with in the classes which were being inherited and allowing inheritance.

2.private(__var)--->as same like before in single class.
