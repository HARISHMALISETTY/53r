VARIABLE IN PYTHON:
---------------------
VARIABLE
USE CASE OF VARIABLES
RULES TO BE FOLLOW WHILE USING VARIABLE
HOW THE DATA CAN BE ASSIGNED TO VARIABLE
HOW PYTHON MANAGES MEMORY FOR VARIABLES.


VARIABLE IS NOTHING BUT A CONTAINER TO STORE THE VALUE/INFORMATION/DATA TO PERFORM OPERATIONS, COMPUTATIONS AND REUSE THE DATA THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM.

js--->a
a=5

python--->x=4 

in python we have to assign value to the variable in starting itself.

x=4

1.variable names should not contain emptyspace,
2.should not starts with numbers
3.variable names are case sensitive
4.we cant use special characters except _
5. we cant use keywords/reserved words as a variable name.

camelCase-->firstName
pascalcase--->FirstName
snakecase--->frst_name
kebabcase---->first-name

x=5---->integer
y=5.5--->float
z="hello"---->string

id()--->is used to get the id/memory address of a object
print()--->to display the output
type()---->is used to check and print the type of the data

x=5
x=1.2
x="harish"


in python, variables will changes its type based on the data automatically. so we can say python is a dynamically typed language.


as we know, python works with high speed.by following few optimizing techniques.
1.memory pooling--->same memory will be allocates if the value is same(-5 to 256)
2.interning.--->same memory will be allocates if the string is small and same.
3.garbage collection-->unused objects/values can be identified and throw into the garbage by garbage collector.



these two process will follow the caching.(just remembering or keeping in mind for sometime)

"""--->used to write multiline strings in python
print(f"")--->formatting and printing purpose
input()--->to take input from user
