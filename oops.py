# OOPS--->

# 1.pop-->procedural oriented programming
# 2.fop-->functional oriented programming
# 3.oop-->object oriented programming

# programming approaches/paradigm/system/style

# python can use all 3 approaches, so we can called
# python is a multiparadigm support language.

# pops--->
# it will split the task into multiple sub tasks as a small procedures into a functions.
# it will follow top to bottom approach

# fops--->it will also same but uses pure functions like recursive functions,map,filter.


# if we declared any variable globally, that variable will be not in private mode.in pops and fops.

# pops and fops only focus on operations on data
# but oops will focus on both operations and data security
# oops will follow bottom -top approach.

# oops will use in multiple sectors like:
# 1.AI
# 2.EXPERT SYSTEMS
# 3.CLIENT-SERVER MODELS
# 4.DATABASES.



# OOPS WAS INTRODUCED BY ALEN KAY IN 1966 FOR SIMULATION PROGRAMMING.
# FIRST OOP WAS USED IN SIMULA PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.

# LATER OOPS DEVELOPED AND USED FULLFLEDGED IN C++.

# OOPS WILL SUPPORTS IN
# JAVA
# PHP
# C++
# PYTHON
# JS

# we use multiple objects in oops based programming.
# those objects will born from the classes.


# every object will contains properties and behaviour.
# pen is a object.

# properties of pen(object):
# ---------------------------
# 1.color of pen
# 2.company manufacture
# 3.price

# to define properties for a object-->we use variables or attributes.

# behaviour:
# ----------
# used to write.

# to represent or define behaviour of object, we will use methods.

# 1.class
# 2.object
# 3.inheritance
# 4.encapsulation
# 5.polymorphism
# 6.abstraction
